## Introduction

Pet owners face major challenges in ensuring the safety and health of their pets due to the lack of real-time visibility and delayed response to emergencies. Pets cannot communicate health issues or dangerous situations, making timely intervention difficult.

**PetGuard Pro** addresses this problem by providing an IoT-based smart pet collar combined with a mobile application and a cloud backend. The system enables real-time location tracking, geo-fencing alerts, health monitoring, and instant notifications to ensure proactive and reliable pet care.

---

## Solution Architecture

PetGuard Pro follows a **device–cloud–mobile architecture**:

- **Smart Pet Collar** collects location, activity, and health data using onboard sensors.
- **Cloud Backend (AWS)** securely receives, processes, and stores data while handling alerts and scalability.
- **Mobile Application (Flutter)** allows pet owners to monitor their pets in real time and receive notifications.

Communication between the collar and cloud is handled using **MQTT**, while secure **HTTPS** APIs serve the mobile application.
